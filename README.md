content adicted
===

Is a nano web application framework for PHP5.

It's based on the [Tyke framework](http://github.com/digitarald/tyke/tree/master) by Harald Kirschner but has more features like security management and database handling.
It enables developers to write clean, maintainable and extensible code.

Minimum Requirements
---

Content adicted requires PHP 5.2.x, although it doesn't require any external libraries.
For database function call abstraction content adicted uses PDO which comes bundled with PHP5.
You can easily extend content adicted to use any other database handler that fit your needs.
